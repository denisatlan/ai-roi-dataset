## Abstract

This technical report presents an empirical analysis of 200 artificial intelligence (AI) deployments in French B2B companies between 2022 and 2025. The dataset provides quantitative evidence of AI return on investment (ROI), deployment durations, cost structures, and failure patterns across multiple sectors and company sizes.

**Key findings:** The dataset shows a median ROI of 159.8% over a 24-month horizon, with a failure rate of 17.5% (significantly below the 80-95% market benchmark). Deployment timelines range from 90-120 days for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to 365-540 days for large corporations. The "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) governance model, adopted in 88.5% of projects, correlates with higher success rates.

**Implications:** This dataset challenges the prevailing narrative of AI project failure in enterprises and provides empirical benchmarks for practitioners. The data suggest that structured deployment methodologies, HITL governance, and pragmatic scoping significantly improve AI project outcomes.

**Keywords:** Artificial Intelligence, ROI, B2B, Deployment, France, Digital Transformation, Human-in-the-Loop, Benchmarks

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context & Motivation

The deployment of artificial intelligence in B2B enterprises has been characterized by high failure rates. Recent studies (MIT 2025, Gartner 2024, Rand Corporation 2024) report failure rates between 80% and 95%, with "failure" defined as projects never reaching production or failing to achieve positive ROI within 24 months.

The primary causes identified include:
- Technical integration difficulties (39%)
- Insufficient data quality (70% of cases)
- Cost overruns and unclear business cases (35%)
- Human resistance to change (31%)
- Skills gaps (28%)

However, these studies primarily focus on large enterprises attempting in-house development ("Build" strategy). There exists a knowledge gap regarding AI deployments following structured methodologies, external expertise, and hybrid "Buy + Integrate" approaches—particularly in the SME and mid-market (ETI) segments.

### 1.2 Objectives

This dataset and report aim to:

1. **Quantify ROI** across sectors, company sizes, and use cases
2. **Measure deployment timelines** from diagnostic to positive ROI
3. **Identify failure patterns** and root causes
4. **Evaluate the impact** of Human-in-the-Loop governance
5. **Provide actionable benchmarks** for practitioners and decision-makers

### 1.3 Scope & Limitations

**Geographic scope:** France (primarily Lyon and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region)  
**Temporal scope:** January 2022 to December 2025  
**Company types:** B2B enterprises (10 to 500+ employees)  
**Deployment types:** Automation, NLP, Analytics, Computer Vision, Hybrid

**Known limitations:**
- **Selection bias:** Dataset reflects successful deployment methodology; market-wide failure rates are higher
- **Geographic specificity:** French market dynamics (regulations, labor costs, digital maturity)
- **ROI measurement period:** 24-month horizon may underestimate long-term value
- **Evolving technology:** Period spans rapid GenAI adoption (2023-2025), affecting comparability

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection

**Data sources:**
- Direct client projects (n=165, 82.5%)
- Advisory/audit engagements (n=28, 14%)
- Documented case studies from partners (n=7, 3.5%)

**Collection period:** January 2022 to December 2025

**Inclusion criteria:**
- B2B enterprise (≥10 employees)
- AI deployment reaching production stage or explicit project termination
- Minimum 6-month post-deployment tracking (for ROI measurement)
- Documented investment and gains data

**Exclusion criteria:**
- Pure R&D projects without production intent
- Consumer-facing (B2C) applications
- Projects still in POC phase without definitive outcome

### 2.2 Variables & Definitions

#### Project Identifiers
- `project_id`: Unique anonymized identifier (P001-P200)
- `year`, `quarter`: Temporal markers

#### Company Characteristics
- `sector`: Industry vertical (10 categories)
- `company_size`: SME (10-49), ETI (50-249), Large (250+)
- `revenue_m_eur`: Annual revenue in millions of euros

#### AI Deployment Characteristics
- `ai_use_case`: Primary business objective (8 categories)
- `deployment_type`: Technical category (Automation, NLP, Analytics, Vision, Hybrid)
- `human_in_loop`: Binary (0=Fully automated, 1=HITL governance)

#### Timeline Metrics
- `days_diagnostic`: Duration of initial assessment phase
- `days_poc`: Proof-of-concept development duration
- `days_to_deployment`: Total time from kickoff to production
- `days_to_positive_roi`: Time until cumulative gains exceed investment

#### Financial Metrics
- `investment_eur`: Total investment (CAPEX + Year 1 OPEX)
- `annual_gain_eur`: Measured annual economic gain (post-deployment)
- `roi_percent`: Calculated as `(annual_gain * 2 - investment) / investment * 100`

#### Outcome Metrics
- `failure`: Binary (0=Success, 1=Failure)
- `failure_reason`: Root cause (categorical, 6 categories)
- `time_saved_hours_month`: Productivity gain in hours per month

### 2.3 ROI Calculation Methodology

ROI is calculated using a 24-month horizon:

```
ROI (%) = [(Annual Gain × 2) - Investment] / Investment × 100
```

**Rationale:**
- 24-month period balances short-term business pressure with AI maturation time
- Conservative approach: does not account for Years 3+ value (likely underestimates total ROI)
- Gains are measured via documented KPIs (time saved, cost reduction, revenue increase)

**Failure definition:**
- Project terminated before production, OR
- ROI remains negative after 24 months

**For ETIs (50-249 employees):**
- **Invest:** €60-100k for strategic project (median: €84k)
- **Timeline:** 180-270 days to production, 270-365 days to positive ROI
- **Focus:** Process optimization, predictive analytics, advanced automation
- **Key success factor:** Data preparation (70% of time should be data work)

**For Large Enterprises (250+ employees):**
- **Invest:** €300-600k for enterprise-scale deployment (median: €414k)
- **Timeline:** 365-540 days to production, 365-730 days to positive ROI
- **Focus:** Platform approach (reusable components), multiple use cases
- **Key success factor:** Governance (HITL frameworks, compliance management)

### 12.2 Risk Mitigation

**Top 3 failure causes → mitigation strategies:**

1. **Data quality (31.4% of failures):**
   - **Mitigate:** Invest 40-50% of project time in data audit & cleaning
   - **Red flag:** If data audit reveals <60% completeness, delay project

2. **Technical integration (22.9% of failures):**
   - **Mitigate:** API-first architecture, avoid deep legacy system modifications
   - **Red flag:** If integration requires >30% of budget, re-scope or abort

3. **Resistance to change (17.1% of failures):**
   - **Mitigate:** HITL governance (88.5% of successful projects), user co-design
   - **Red flag:** If end-users not involved in POC, escalate to leadership

### 12.3 Sector-Specific Recommendations

**Retail:** Prioritize revenue-generating use cases (pricing, personalization) over cost-reduction.

**Finance:** Budget 20-30% extra time for compliance (AI Act, GDPR explainability).

**Manufacturing:** Focus on downtime reduction (maintenance, quality) — highest ROI lever.

**Construction:** Wait for ecosystem maturity OR partner with digitally-mature subcontractors.

## 13. Future Research Directions

### 13.1 Longitudinal Tracking (Years 3-5)

**Question:** Does ROI continue to grow post-Year 2, or plateau?

**Method:** Re-survey projects from 2022-2023 cohort in 2027-2028.

**Hypothesis:** ROI may increase due to:
- Model improvements (continuous learning)
- Expanded use cases (organizational learning)
- Reduced maintenance costs (maturity)

### 13.2 GenAI-Specific Analysis

**Question:** How do GenAI projects (LLMs, chatbots) differ from traditional ML (predictive analytics, computer vision)?

**Method:** Segment dataset by technology type, compare ROI, timelines, failure rates.

**Preliminary observation:** 2024-2025 projects show faster POC times (GenAI APIs) but higher ongoing costs (token usage).

### 13.3 Human-in-the-Loop Depth Study

**Question:** What specific HITL practices drive higher success rates?

**Method:** Qualitative interviews + quantitative analysis of HITL implementation depth.

**Variables to explore:**
- Validation frequency (per decision, batch, periodic)
- Feedback loop speed (real-time vs. weekly)
- Escalation pathways (rules-based vs. human judgment)

### 13.4 International Comparison

**Question:** How do French results compare to Germany, UK, US?

**Method:** Partner with international consultancies to replicate methodology.

**Expected outcome:** French results may show lower ROI (higher labor costs) but similar failure rates.

## 14. Conclusion

This dataset of 200 AI deployments in French B2B companies (2022-2025) provides empirical evidence that challenges prevailing narratives of AI project failure. With a success rate of 82.5% (vs. 5-20% market benchmark) and median ROI of 159.8%, the data suggest that structured deployment methodologies, external expertise, and Human-in-the-Loop governance significantly improve outcomes.

**Key takeaways:**

1. **Failure rates can be dramatically reduced** through pragmatic scoping, data preparation, and HITL governance.

2. **ROI varies widely by sector:** Retail (242%), Finance (187%), Manufacturing (171%) outperform, while Construction (62%) lags due to digital maturity gaps.

3. **Company size matters for timelines, not ROI:** SMEs deploy 4x faster (94 vs. 387 days) but achieve similar ROI percentages.

4. **Human-in-the-Loop is not optional:** 88.5% adoption rate among successful projects, with 30% higher success probability vs. fully automated approaches.

5. **Investment scales linearly with gains:** Median 2.5-2.7x annual gain vs. investment across all company sizes.

**Limitations:** This dataset reflects a specific methodology (external expertise, structured approach) and geographic focus (France). Results are not representative of all AI projects but demonstrate what is achievable under "best practice" conditions.

**For practitioners:** Use this data as aspirational benchmarks, not market averages. Success requires discipline, expertise, and pragmatism — not just technology.
