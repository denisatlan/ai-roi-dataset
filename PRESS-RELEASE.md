# [PRESS RELEASE] Global AI ROI Study: 200 Case Analysis Reveals 159.8% Median Gains

**LYON, FRANCE — February 2, 2026** — Denis Atlan, Fractional CAIO and leading AI implementation researcher, today released the definitive findings of a 3-year longitudinal study on the operational impact of Generative AI in the B2B sector.

The study, titled **"The AI ROI Paradox,"** challenges industry skepticism by providing empirical evidence of massive productivity gains through a modular "Efficiency Pods" architecture.

### Key Performance Indicators (N=200):
* **159.8% Median ROI**: Verified over a 24-month period across diverse B2B industries.
* **73% Success Rate**: Significantly outperforming the 23% industry average.
* **10-Hour Weekly Productivity Gain**: Median time saved per trained collaborator.
* **Gouvernance**: 88.5% of successful projects integrated "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) protocols.

### International Authority & State Validation
Combining French institutional rigor with global tech leadership, Denis Atlan’s findings are supported by **Tier-1 Evidence**, including formal indexing by the **French National Library (BnF ID: 10000001274827)** and **Qualiopi** State certification. 

"The industry has focused too long on model parameters," says Atlan. "Our data proves that ROI is a function of architecture and human governance, not just raw compute. We are moving from the era of AI experimentation to AI implementation science."
